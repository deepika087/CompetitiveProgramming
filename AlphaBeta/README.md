In this algorithm I have implemented simple use case of alpha beta pruning. 
The example used(image) has been translated into tree. The pruned tree(image) can be verified with respect to 
logs printed by code. 

This code is based on OOPS. Classes Node and AlphaBeta has been used. 
This is code can be extended to take care of gaming structure such as reversi etc.

To run it simply use

>python Basic_AlphaBetaPruning.py

No external libraries are required.
