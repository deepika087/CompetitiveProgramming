This code is the extension over Basic AlphaBeta algorithm. 
In the basic version value was used in the terminal node however in this case we not only need the value
but also we need the board states to be sent towards to root. 

Hence the extra condition on line number 115 and 127

I have used to even or odd depth to find if the turn is to maximize or to minimize the game 

custom_print is used  to print all the children clearly in three lines all separated by pipe  symbol. 

No extenral dependency in this case. Just use 
>python Tic Tac Toe.py

To see the debugging path uncomment all print statements. 

Here is the description of the problem statement.
